First off, thank you for considering contributing to Upme. I appreciate it very much.

### Found a bug?

### Want to add a feature?
If you have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue to discuss it first. This helps ensure that the feature aligns with the project's goals and that it won't duplicate existing work.

### Code style
Please configure your editor to use the .editorconfig file in the root of the repository.
