__Upme__ will be a library for adding self-update capabilities to Java desktop applications. Its main goals are simplicity and robustness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Despite the small amount of time I am able to dedicate to this project currently and therefore its really slow progress, I didn't give up on it. Due to my studies, other side projects and an exchange semester I will do abroad, I will probably not be able to spend much time on it until next winter. However, I do look forward to making this little dream of mine come true. Expect updates in late 2026 / 2027.

## Features
- [x] fetch updates from custom web server
- [x] fetch updates from Github Releases
- [ ] show progress
- [ ] high-level wrapper for the average use-case of simply updating to the latest version
- [ ] automatically restart after the update
- [ ] rollback on error
- [ ] ability to clean up used temporary files
- [ ] logging to a file
- [ ] automatically elevate permissions permissions if needed
