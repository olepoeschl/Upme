<!-- What is Upme? -->
Ever wondered why the entire Java ecosystem doesn't provide a single ready-to-use library to add self-update capabilities to desktop apps?
<br>Me too - that's why I create Upme. Its main goals are ease of use, extensibility and robustness.

Features:
- [ ] archive-based updates
    - [ ] keep important application files, e.g. user data
    - [ ] optional restart after the update
    - [ ] rollback on error
    - [ ] create log file
    - [ ] cleanup temporary files
    - [ ] automatically ask for admin permissions if needed
    - [ ] full replacement of all application files
    - [ ] incremental patch based on changes
- [ ] installer-based updates
- [ ] fetch updates from custom web server
- [ ] fetch updates from Github Releases

<!--## Getting started-->
<!-- How to use Upme in your project, with code snippets -->

<!-- ## Example project -->
<!-- link a separate repository as a working example -->

## How it works
Upme breaks the update process down into three stages. The diagram below illustrates the high-level architecture:
