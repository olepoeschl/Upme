__Upme__ is a simple library to add self-update capabilities to Java desktop applications. Its main goals are ease of use, extensibility and robustness.
While the diagram above shows a common, but very simple use-case, the library also provides more low-level control.

## Features
- [ ] super high-level wrapper for the average use-case: update to the latest version
- [ ] archive-based updates
    - [ ] keep important application files, e.g. user data
    - [ ] optional restart after the update
    - [ ] rollback on error
    - [ ] create log file
    - [ ] cleanup temporary files
    - [ ] automatically ask for admin permissions if needed
    - [ ] full replacement of all application files
    - [ ] incremental patch based on changes
- [ ] installer-based updates
- [ ] select desired new version out of a list of available updates
- [ ] fetch updates from custom web server
- [ ] fetch updates from Github Releases
