__Upme__ is a simple library to add self-update capabilities to Java desktop applications. Its main goals are ease of use, extensibility and robustness.
While the diagram above shows a common, but very simple use-case, the library also provides more low-level control.

## Features
- [ ] high-level wrapper for the average use-case of updating to the latest version
- [ ] archive-based full-replacement updates
- [ ] configure which files to preserve during update
- [ ] restarting after update
- [ ] rollback on error
- [ ] create log file
- [ ] clean up temporary files
- [ ] automatically elevate permissions permissions if needed
- [ ] select desired new version out of a list of available updates
- [ ] fetch updates from custom web server
- [ ] fetch updates from Github Releases
- [ ] support multiple download links for a single update
- [ ] support for platform-specific updates
